**Goal:** Make sure that you bump your version string everywhere it may appear, in unison, prior to publishing your package.  A version number can be in `init.py`, `setup.cfg`, etc.

In increasing order of work, but decreasing order of magic, the methods of bummping your version string are listed below. 

## Using git tags:  
setuptools_scm: [https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm)

   `# configure in pyproject.toml, thenâ€¦`  
   `$ git tag -a v0.1.0 -m v0.1.0`  

  The next time you run <font color="red">`python -m build`</font>, either locally or in GitHub actions, your package version will be based on the latest git tag.

## Using a local script to edit files:  
One tool for doing this is [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version). For example:
```console
   $ pip install bump2version  
   # then configure all the places you use your version   
   $ bump2version -$current-version 0.5.1 minor  
```   

## Manually
This is ***not*** recommended, you *will* eventually make mistakes and have mismatched version/metadata somewhere.  
  
  ### *The "best" versioning and deployment workflow is the one you will actually use!*  
  
       
Get comfortable with at least one workflow for versioning and deploying your package  
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . *otherwise, you won't do it.*
